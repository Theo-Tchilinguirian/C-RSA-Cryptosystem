Current project ideas :

RSA Cryptosystem, encrypting using prime and semi-prime numbers.
Vigenere cipher or the more advanced (and theoretically impossible to break) OTP.

The need to implement a random number generator is implied (RNG or TRNG).

Language choice : C for speed and portability or ASM for more speed (but restricted portability to similar architectures).
